  Olvid does not require any personal data: no phone number, no email, no name, no surname, no address, no date of birth.
  With Olvid, everything is end-to-end encrypted using cryptographic protocols with unrivalled power. Your messages & attachments are systematically protected.
  Olvid’s cryptographic protocols are able to guarantee the security of your data even if our servers are hacked
  No nothing
  Unlike your previous messenger, Olvid will never request access to your address book
  Six years of R&D have enabled us to propose a solution that makes no compromise on safety, while remaining very simple to use. 
  Your exchanges leave no digital trace. No one will ever know who you’ve discussed with.
  Not even us.
